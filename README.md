# Banklytics: Retail Banking Performance & Risk Analytics

## Overview

Banklytics is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to showcase SQL proficiency and business acumen in the context of a modern retail banking environment.  
The project uses **MySQL** to model core banking entities—customers, accounts, products, and transactions—while enabling deep-dive analytics into customer behavior, product uptake, and risk identification.

The repository emphasizes robust data modeling, advanced SQL (window functions, CTEs, complex joins), and analytical reporting. Power BI dashboards further bring the data to life, enabling performance monitoring and risk detection.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Customer segmentation & value analysis
- Product engagement & portfolio trends
- Transactional analytics for business and risk insights
- Foundations for decision-support (e.g., customer targeting, risk alerts)
